- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions Policy for browser features
- Server information hiding

**HTTPS Enforcement:**
- Production HTTPS requirement
- Development environment flexibility
- Proper header validation for secure connections

### 5. Security Monitoring and Audit Logging

**Files:**
- `src/services/securityAuditService.ts` - Comprehensive security event logging
- `src/middleware/security.ts` - Security audit middleware

**Features:**
- Real-time security event logging
- Threat detection and alerting
- Security statistics and reporting
- Event categorization by severity (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- IP-based threat tracking
- Automated alert thresholds for suspicious activity

**Event Types Monitored:**
- Authentication failures
- Malicious input detection
- File threat detection
- Rate limit violations
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts
- Path traversal attempts
- Brute force attempts

### 6. Configuration and Environment Security

**Files:**
- `src/config/security.ts` - Environment-specific security configuration
- `src/config/index.ts` - Enhanced configuration with security settings

**Features:**
- Environment-specific security policies
- Configurable file upload limits and allowed types
- Trusted IP configuration for admin endpoints
- Security feature toggles (virus scanning, content validation)
- Production vs development security profiles

## Security Testing

**Files:**
- `src/__tests__/security.test.ts` - Comprehensive security test suite

**Test Coverage:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- File security scanning
- Rate limiting functionality
- Security headers validation
- File upload security integration
- Content validation for various file types

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

```bash
# File Security
MAX_FILE_SIZE=50MB
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=image/jpeg,image/png,application/pdf,text/plain
ENABLE_VIRUS_SCANNING=true

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# Security Features
TRUSTED_IPS=192.168.1.1,10.0.0.1
```

### Security Configuration

The security configuration supports different profiles:

- **Production**: Maximum security with all features enabled
- **Development**: Relaxed limits for development convenience
- **Testing**: Minimal security for test execution

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
2. **Fail Secure**: Default to secure behavior when validation fails
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions and access controls
4. **Input Validation**: All input validated and sanitized
5. **Output Encoding**: Proper encoding of output data
6. **Security Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
7. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information disclosure
8. **File Security**: Multi-layered file validation and scanning

## Integration with Existing Systems

The security implementation integrates seamlessly with:

- **Authentication System**: Enhanced with security monitoring
- **File Service**: Integrated security scanning before S3 upload
- **API Endpoints**: Automatic validation and sanitization
- **Database Operations**: SQL injection prevention
- **Monitoring System**: Security event integration

## Performance Considerations

- **Asynchronous Processing**: File security scanning doesn't block requests
- **Caching**: Security validation results cached where appropriate
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Optimized pattern matching for threat detection
- **Resource Limits**: Configurable limits to prevent resource exhaustion

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Virus Scanning**: Integration with commercial antivirus APIs
2. **Machine Learning**: AI-based threat detection
3. **External Monitoring**: Integration with SIEM systems
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Security metrics and dashboards
5. **Automated Response**: Automatic threat mitigation

## Compliance and Standards

The implementation follows security best practices from:

- OWASP Top 10 security risks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- ISO 27001 security standards
- Industry-standard file security practices

## Monitoring and Alerting

Security events are automatically:

1. **Logged**: Structured logging for analysis
2. **Categorized**: By severity and threat type
3. **Aggregated**: Statistics and trends tracking
4. **Alerted**: Automatic alerts for critical threats
5. **Exported**: Data export for external analysis

## Conclusion

The security implementation provides comprehensive protection against common web application threats while maintaining performance and usability. The modular design allows for easy extension and customization based on specific security requirements.

All security features are thoroughly tested and documented, ensuring reliable protection for the ClassBoard application and its users.
