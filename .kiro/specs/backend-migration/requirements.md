# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing React web application from a frontend-only architecture with mock data to a full-stack solution with a proper backend API and AWS cloud services. The migration will be gradual, maintaining the current web app functionality while building and testing the backend infrastructure. The goal is to create a shared backend that can serve both the existing web application and future React Native mobile app, ensuring consistent data structure and business logic across platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher using the web application, I want the app to continue working normally during the backend migration, so that my daily teaching activities are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend migration is in progress THEN the existing React web app SHALL remain fully functional
2. WHEN new API endpoints are deployed THEN the web app SHALL gradually integrate with them without breaking existing features
3. WHEN data is migrated to the backend THEN all existing user data SHALL be preserved and accessible
4. IF an API endpoint fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to ensure continued operation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert existing TypeScript interfaces and mock data into proper database models and API endpoints, so that the application has a robust backend foundation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing TypeScript interfaces are analyzed THEN they SHALL be converted to database schema models
2. WHEN mock data operations are identified THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper API endpoints
3. WHEN CRUD operations from AppDataContext are converted THEN they SHALL become RESTful API endpoints
4. WHEN localStorage authentication is replaced THEN it SHALL use JWT or session-based authentication
5. IF data models include relationships THEN the database schema SHALL properly represent these relationships

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend to use AWS services for scalability and reliability, so that the application can handle growth and provide consistent performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is implemented THEN it SHALL use AWS RDS PostgreSQL for relational data storage
2. WHEN file storage is needed THEN it SHALL use AWS S3 with CloudFront for profile pictures and document uploads
3. WHEN user authentication is implemented THEN it SHALL use AWS Cognito for secure user management
4. WHEN background processing is needed THEN it SHALL use AWS Lambda for grade calculations and automated tasks
5. IF complex queries are required THEN PostgreSQL SHALL support reporting and analytics operations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer preparing for mobile app development, I want a shared backend API, so that both web and mobile applications can use the same data source and business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL be platform-agnostic and usable by both web and mobile clients
2. WHEN data structures are defined THEN they SHALL be consistent across all client platforms
3. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL reside in the backend to ensure consistency
4. WHEN the API is designed THEN it SHALL follow RESTful principles for easy integration
5. IF authentication is required THEN it SHALL work seamlessly across web and mobile platforms

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want to test the backend functionality with the existing UI, so that I can validate the API integration before adding mobile complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend endpoints are developed THEN they SHALL be testable with the current React web app
2. WHEN API integration occurs THEN data flows SHALL be validated through the existing user interface
3. WHEN authentication is migrated THEN login/logout functionality SHALL work correctly with the web app
4. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN response times SHALL meet or exceed current mock data performance
5. IF issues are discovered THEN they SHALL be resolved before proceeding with mobile development

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want all my existing data (classes, students, grades, attendance) to be properly migrated to the new backend, so that I don't lose any important information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data migration occurs THEN all Classes, Students, and Schedules data SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN educational records are migrated THEN Tests, TestResults, and Homework data SHALL remain intact
3. WHEN attendance records are transferred THEN all Attendance, Meetings, and ClassNotes SHALL be accessible
4. WHEN user accounts are migrated THEN authentication credentials SHALL be securely transferred
5. IF data integrity issues arise THEN they SHALL be resolved before completing the migration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to upload and manage files (profile pictures, assignments, resources), so that I can enhance my teaching materials and student interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading profile pictures THEN they SHALL be stored securely in AWS S3
2. WHEN teachers upload resources THEN they SHALL be accessible to appropriate students
3. WHEN students submit assignments THEN file uploads SHALL be properly organized and stored
4. WHEN files are accessed THEN CloudFront SHALL provide fast global delivery
5. IF file size limits are exceeded THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed
