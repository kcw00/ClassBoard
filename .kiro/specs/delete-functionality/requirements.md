# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds delete functionality for classes and students in the ClassBoard application. Currently, users can create and edit classes and students, but there is no way to remove them from the system. This creates data management challenges as teachers accumulate outdated or incorrect entries over time. The delete functionality will provide a safe and intuitive way to remove classes and students while maintaining data integrity and providing appropriate safeguards against accidental deletions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to delete classes that are no longer needed, so that I can keep my class list organized and current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the class management screen THEN the system SHALL display a delete button for each class
2. WHEN clicking the delete button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before proceeding
3. WHEN confirming deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the class from the database
4. WHEN a class is deleted THEN all associated data (students, notes, attendance, tests) SHALL be handled appropriately
5. IF a class has associated data THEN the system SHALL warn the user about data loss before deletion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to delete students who are no longer in my classes, so that I can maintain accurate student rosters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the student management screen THEN the system SHALL display a delete button for each student
2. WHEN clicking the delete button THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog before proceeding
3. WHEN confirming deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove the student from the database
4. WHEN a student is deleted THEN all associated data (attendance records, test results, notes) SHALL be handled appropriately
5. IF a student has associated data THEN the system SHALL warn the user about data loss before deletion

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to be protected from accidental deletions, so that I don't lose important data by mistake.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to delete a class or student THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation
2. WHEN showing confirmation dialogs THEN the system SHALL clearly state what will be deleted
3. WHEN a class or student has associated data THEN the system SHALL list what related data will be affected
4. WHEN confirming deletion THEN the system SHALL require a deliberate action (not just clicking away)
5. IF deletion is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return to the previous state without changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want to understand the impact of deleting a class or student, so that I can make informed decisions about data removal.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to delete a class THEN the system SHALL show how many students, notes, and records will be affected
2. WHEN attempting to delete a student THEN the system SHALL show how many attendance records and test results will be affected
3. WHEN displaying impact information THEN the system SHALL use clear, non-technical language
4. WHEN showing data counts THEN the system SHALL be accurate and up-to-date
5. IF no associated data exists THEN the system SHALL indicate that deletion is safe

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want delete operations to maintain database integrity, so that the application remains stable and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a class is deleted THEN all foreign key relationships SHALL be properly handled
2. WHEN a student is deleted THEN all related records SHALL be removed or updated appropriately
3. WHEN deletion fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and maintain data consistency
4. WHEN concurrent deletions occur THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions gracefully
5. IF deletion violates business rules THEN the system SHALL prevent the operation and explain why

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want delete functionality to be easily accessible but not accidentally triggered, so that I can manage my data efficiently without fear of mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing class or student lists THEN delete buttons SHALL be clearly visible but styled to indicate caution
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN delete buttons SHALL be appropriately sized to prevent accidental taps
3. WHEN delete buttons are displayed THEN they SHALL use recognizable icons and colors (typically red)
4. WHEN hovering over delete buttons THEN the system SHALL provide helpful tooltips
5. IF a user frequently deletes items THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI patterns

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want feedback when deletions are successful, so that I know the operation completed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a deletion is successful THEN the system SHALL show a success message
2. WHEN items are removed THEN the UI SHALL update immediately to reflect the changes
3. WHEN displaying success messages THEN they SHALL be clear and specific about what was deleted
