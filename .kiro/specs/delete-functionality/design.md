# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the implementation of delete functionality for classes and students in the ClassBoard application. The backend API already supports delete operations through existing endpoints (`DELETE /api/classes/:id` and `DELETE /api/students/:id`), and the AppDataService has corresponding methods. The focus of this design is to add user interface components and confirmation dialogs to safely expose this functionality to teachers.

The design follows the existing UI patterns in the application, using consistent styling, confirmation dialogs, and error handling. The implementation will add delete buttons to both the ClassManagement and StudentManagement screens, with appropriate safeguards to prevent accidental deletions.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Delete Button Component**: Reusable button component with consistent styling
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Modal dialog for confirming delete operations
- **Impact Information Display**: Component showing what data will be affected by deletion
- **Error Handling**: Integration with existing toast notification system

### Backend Integration
- **Existing API Endpoints**: Leverage existing `DELETE /api/classes/:id` and `DELETE /api/students/:id`
- **AppDataService Methods**: Use existing `deleteClass()` and `deleteStudent()` methods
- **Error Handling**: Utilize existing error handling middleware and response patterns

### Data Flow
1. User clicks delete button → Confirmation dialog opens
2. User confirms deletion → API call made through AppDataService
3. Backend processes deletion → Response returned
4. Frontend updates UI → Success/error message displayed

## Components and Interfaces

### DeleteButton Component
```typescript
interface DeleteButtonProps {
  onDelete: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  variant?: 'ghost' | 'outline' | 'destructive';
  tooltip?: string;
}
```

### ConfirmationDialog Component
```typescript
interface ConfirmationDialogProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
  onConfirm: () => void;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  itemName: string;
  impactInfo?: {
    affectedItems: Array<{
      type: string;
      count: number;
      description: string;
    }>;
  };
  isLoading?: boolean;
}
```

### Delete Operation Types
```typescript
interface DeleteOperation {
  type: 'class' | 'student';
  id: string;
  name: string;
  impactInfo: {
    affectedItems: Array<{
      type: string;
      count: number;
      description: string;
    }>;
  };
}
```

## Data Models

### Class Deletion Impact
When deleting a class, the system needs to show:
- Number of enrolled students
- Number of class notes
- Number of attendance records
- Number of tests/assessments
- Number of meetings
- Number of schedules

### Student Deletion Impact
When deleting a student, the system needs to show:
- Number of enrolled classes
- Number of attendance records
- Number of test results
- Number of homework submissions

### Impact Calculation Service
```typescript
interface ImpactCalculationService {
  calculateClassDeletionImpact(classId: string): Promise<DeletionImpact>;
  calculateStudentDeletionImpact(studentId: string): Promise<DeletionImpact>;
}

interface DeletionImpact {
  affectedItems: Array<{
    type: string;
    count: number;
    description: string;
  }>;
  hasAssociatedData: boolean;
  warningMessage?: string;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Error Types
1. **Network Errors**: Connection issues, timeout
2. **Authorization Errors**: User not authorized to delete
3. **Constraint Violations**: Database constraints preventing deletion
4. **Not Found Errors**: Item already deleted or doesn't exist
5. **Concurrent Modification**: Item modified by another user

### Error Messages
- **Network Error**: "Unable to delete [item]. Please check your connection and try again."
- **Authorization Error**: "You don't have permission to delete this [item]."
- **Not Found Error**: "This [item] has already been deleted or no longer exists."
- **Constraint Violation**: "Cannot delete [item] because it has associated data. Please remove related records first."
- **Generic Error**: "An error occurred while deleting [item]. Please try again."

### Error Recovery
- Retry mechanism for network errors
- Refresh data after failed operations
- Clear loading states on error
- Maintain UI consistency during error states

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
1. **DeleteButton Component**
   - Renders correctly with different props
   - Calls onDelete when clicked
   - Shows correct tooltip text
   - Handles disabled state

2. **ConfirmationDialog Component**
   - Displays correct title and description
   - Shows impact information correctly
   - Calls onConfirm when confirmed
   - Calls onClose when cancelled
   - Handles loading state during deletion

3. **Impact Calculation**
   - Correctly calculates class deletion impact
   - Correctly calculates student deletion impact
   - Handles cases with no associated data
   - Handles cases with extensive associated data

### Integration Tests
1. **Class Deletion Flow**
   - Delete button appears in class management
   - Confirmation dialog opens with correct information
   - API call made with correct parameters
   - UI updates after successful deletion
   - Error handling for failed deletions

2. **Student Deletion Flow**
   - Delete button appears in student management
   - Confirmation dialog opens with correct information
   - API call made with correct parameters
   - UI updates after successful deletion
   - Error handling for failed deletions

### End-to-End Tests
1. **Complete Deletion Workflow**
   - Navigate to management screen
   - Click delete button
   - Review impact information
   - Confirm deletion
   - Verify item removed from list
   - Verify success message displayed

2. **Cancellation Workflow**
   - Navigate to management screen
   - Click delete button
   - Cancel deletion
   - Verify item still exists
   - Verify no API call made

### Error Scenario Tests
1. **Network Failure During Deletion**
2. **Unauthorized Deletion Attempt**
3. **Concurrent Deletion Scenarios**
4. **Database Constraint Violations**

## UI/UX Design Patterns

### Delete Button Styling
- Use red color scheme to indicate destructive action
- Include trash icon for visual recognition
- Consistent sizing across different contexts
- Hover states for better user feedback

### Confirmation Dialog Design
- Clear, prominent title
- Descriptive text explaining the action
- Impact information prominently displayed
- Two-button layout: Cancel (secondary) and Delete (destructive)
- Loading state during deletion process

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Primary Action**: Cancel button (safer option)
2. **Secondary Action**: Delete button (destructive action)
3. **Information Display**: Impact details clearly separated
4. **Warning Indicators**: Use warning colors for high-impact deletions

### Responsive Design
- Dialog adapts to mobile screen sizes
- Button sizing appropriate for touch interfaces
- Impact information remains readable on small screens
- Proper spacing and padding for accessibility

### Accessibility Considerations
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management in dialogs
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Clear, descriptive text for all actions

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- Verify user permissions before showing delete buttons
- Backend validation of delete permissions
- Proper error messages for unauthorized attempts

### Data Integrity
- Cascade deletion handling for related records
- Transaction-based deletion to ensure consistency
- Backup considerations for accidental deletions

### Audit Trail
- Log all deletion attempts (successful and failed)
- Include user information and timestamps
- Track what data was affected by deletions

## Performance Considerations

### Impact Calculation
- Cache impact calculations for frequently accessed items
- Optimize database queries for counting related records
- Lazy load impact information only when needed

### UI Responsiveness
- Show loading states during deletion operations
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate
- Debounce multiple delete attempts

### Database Operations
- Use efficient cascade deletion strategies
- Batch related record deletions
- Monitor deletion performance and optimize as needed
